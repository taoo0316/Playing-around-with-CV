# Playing-around-with-OpenCV-and-Tensorflow

This is a repository detailing my learning journey with OpenCV and Tensorflow. Computer Vision is an area I would like to explore further in my undergraduate thesis, and this is a starting point for me to gain more familiarity in this field. 


Resources I referred to:
OpenCV tutorial, TowardsDataScience and various tutorials available on YouTube.
